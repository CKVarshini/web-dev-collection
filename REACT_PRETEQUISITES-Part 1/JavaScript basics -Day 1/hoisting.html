<!-- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations 
are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in your code.-->
<script>

/*Variable Hoisting
When variables are hoisted, only their declarations are moved to the top, not the initializations.
If you try to access a variable before it's declared, it will return undefined.
*/
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10


/*
Function Hoisting
Functions are also hoisted to the top of their scope.
This means you can call a function before it's declared in the code.
*/
hello(); // "Hello, hoisted function!"

function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, hoisted function!");
}

/*
Hoisting with let and const
Unlike var, let and const are not hoisted in the same way.
They are hoisted, but they are not initialized until their actual line of code is executed. 
This is known as the "temporal dead zone".
*/
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10

console.log(`sumFunc(1,2)=> ${sumFunc(1,2)}`);
  console.log(`sumConst(1,3)=> ${sumConst(1,3)}`); 
  
  const sumConst = (a,b) => a+b;
  function sumFunc(a,b){
    return a+b;
  } 

/*
Important Notes:
Hoisting is a behavior that happens during the compilation phase, not runtime.
It's generally a good practice to declare variables and functions at the top of 
their scope to avoid unexpected behaviors due to hoisting.
