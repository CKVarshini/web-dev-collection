Event Object:
When an event is triggered, an event object is passed to the event handler function as an 
argument. This object contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the
 target element, key codes (for keyboard events), mouse coordinates, etc.

<html>
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
</html>
// Using the Event Object
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {

  console.log('Target element:', event.target);
});

/*
In this example, event.target refers to the element that triggered the event (in this case, 
the button). The event object provides a lot of useful information that can be used in 
event handling logic.
