Event listeners in JavaScript are used to listen for specific events that occur on DOM elements, 
such as a click, keypress, scroll, etc. When the specified event occurs, the associated function,
also known as an event handler, is executed. This allows developers to create interactive 
web applications where user actions trigger specific behaviors.

To add an event listener to an element, you typically use the addEventListener() method.
 
Here's the basic syntax:
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);

1.element: The DOM element you want to attach the event listener to.
2.event: A string representing the event type, like 'click', 'keyup', 'scroll', etc.
3.function: The function to execute when the event is triggered.
4.useCapture (Optional): A boolean value indicating whether to use event capturing (true) or 
event bubbling (false). Default is false (bubbling phase).
